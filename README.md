Market Basket Analysis Project
Overview
This project focused on leveraging Market Basket Analysis techniques using Python and popular libraries such as pandas, scikit-learn, and mlxtend. Market Basket Analysis is a data mining technique used to identify patterns and associations between products or items frequently purchased together.

Introduction
I undertook a project that involved applying Market Basket Analysis techniques using Python and various libraries, including pandas, scikit-learn, and mlxtend. The primary aim of Market Basket Analysis is to uncover patterns and associations between items frequently bought together in transactions.

Installation
I ensured that Python was installed, and I cloned the repository for the project. I then installed the required dependencies using the following commands:


git clone https://github.com/your-username/market-basket-analysis.git
cd market-basket-analysis

# Installed dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
For running the market basket analysis, I executed the main script with the path to the transaction data:


python main.py --input_data transactions.csv --output_results results.csv
I adjusted parameters such as support, confidence, and lift based on the specific requirements of the analysis.

Data
The dataset used for this analysis consisted of transactional data, where each row represented a unique transaction, and the columns corresponded to the purchased items. I provided details about the source of the data, format, and any preprocessing steps performed.

Analysis
The analysis involved several steps, including data loading, preprocessing, applying the Apriori algorithm using the mlxtend library, and interpreting the results. Example code snippets were included in the README:

python
# Load data
import pandas as pd
transactions = pd.read_csv('transactions.csv')

# Preprocess data

# Apply Apriori algorithm
from mlxtend.frequent_patterns import apriori
from mlxtend.frequent_patterns import association_rules
frequent_itemsets = apriori(transactions, min_support=0.05, use_colnames=True)
rules = association_rules(frequent_itemsets, metric="lift", min_threshold=1)
Results
I summarized key findings and insights obtained from the market basket analysis, including the discovered association rules with support, confidence, and lift metrics.
